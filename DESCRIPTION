Description: Segmentation of short text sequences - like hashtags - into the
    separated words sequence, done with the use of dictionary, which may be
    built on custom corpus of texts. Unigram dictionary is used to find most
    probable sequence, and n-grams approach is used to determine possible
    segmentation given the text corpus.
